<h2 align="center"> <i>Do you want to know who I am??? So let's get to know each other!</i> </h2>


I'm a hobbit technician🔧 (<i>sometimes people compare me to a dwarf, but that's not true... and I'm not a dwarf either!</i>).

I live in Hobbitonia (<i>maximum, in fantasy</i>), I study at the college of magic and wizardry (<i>who said that hobbits are not interested in magic???</i>) called "SfedU" in the direction of gardening and managing evil forces (<i>Mathematical support and administration of information systems...</i>).

>You must follow this path, but it will be difficult to follow. And neither strength nor wisdom could take us very far.

I am very eager to study potions (<i>Android development, Kotlin</i>) and will soon take up infallible alchemy (<i>Java</i>). Throughout my studies, I touched on such areas as: techniques of the school of Charm (<i>Python</i>), strategies of the school of Necromancy (<i>C++</i>), military affairs (<i>Algorithms and OOP</i>), networking (<i>Networking, Linux</i>), recovery (<i>HTML, CSS</i>)🌱. I’m gradually taking my first steps in the skills of soul transposition (<i>Git Bash</i>) and design (<i>Figma</i>).

>Rest if you need to. But don't lose hope.

Favorite activities after college: learning bards in the form of musical instruments (<i>guitar, bass</i>) and acting (<i>board role-playing games</i>), reading their literature (<i>I just like to read art books</i>), and I also love hedgehogs (<i>they are cool!</i>)
